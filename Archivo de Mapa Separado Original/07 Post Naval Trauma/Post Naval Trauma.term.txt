$C0Does it feel good to be back?  you will recognize a distinctive flair for decor that just screams galactic arm. This is the massive Armor Platform of the Lh’owon Naval Unit, a required complement to any planetary Naval Force. It's extremely handy for putting down groundling revolts, but without a native population to oppress, there isn't much action here. The Pfhor use it as an orbital repair and reservice station.

Boomer's forward batteries have slagged engineering and ruptured the hull for you. That's a good start, but now it's your turn.

$C0More than half the Pfhor Armored Vehicles are docked on this ship. You must destroy them all before my humans can begin the ground assault.

Juggernaught shields are typically powered down during repair, so you will find the fusion pistol very effective. You might also want to spend a few seconds thinking about explosions and small spaces. Return here when you’re finished to transport out.

$C0Nice light show. The human strike teams are en route to the location of a S'pht AI whose memories I want to probe. The S'pht life form is a pearl of consciousness, floating in the sea of its own species. If any knowledge remains of the ancient times, it will be collected in the sieve of this massive network, lying dormant for all those centuries.

$C0Intercepted intra ship comm transmissions indicate that they are trying to lock down this section of the ship and minimize your ability to do further damage. Let’s prove that theory wrong.

The blasts from your recent artistry have fried the weapons systems and communications array. The Pfhor are trying desperately to limp home before the engines breach, and are running on emergency power.

$C0There is an auxiliary coolant station here.

Shut it down long enough to take the engines off-line for good, and then get out of the area before the ship goes up. I’ll find a terminal nearby to transport you out.

The drive area is about to breach, and this ship is about to become orbiting slag. With the majority of the Pfhor Armor destroyed, my commandos can begin their assault. The first team has already infiltrated a deserted area of the planet and activated an ancient S'pht AI that I believe is the key to discovering the fate of the eleventh clan.
