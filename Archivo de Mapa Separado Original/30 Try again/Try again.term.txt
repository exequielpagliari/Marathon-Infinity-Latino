$C2Time for you to prove to yourself that you are in fact a true VID-Master. Prepare to embark into the Vidmaster's Challenge!

Go and kill everything you find, and $C5I mean EVERYTHING$C2. You will need to use your skill in killing and destruction to get your butt safely out of this place. 
     
Once you kill everything, I will send you out from another terminal, so don't be coming back here for escape.

$C5Go kick some Pfhor Butt!

$C6PS: No Pattern Buffers are working, so you will have to be really good and not slip up or it's all over for you.

$C2What possessed you to go way out there in the lava and then find this spot? Did you remember it from two years ago or something?

The mark of a true Vidmaster... keep it up!
