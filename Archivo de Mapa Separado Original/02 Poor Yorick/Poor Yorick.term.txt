R'chzne's transmitter is here, but the power source is somewhere inside the ruins.  Find it and destroy it, quickly.  The Pfhor promised me this ship.  I thought R'chzne was my strongest ally, but in the end he watched, pitiless, while they cracked my core like an old chestnut.

When you've penetrated the area and destroyed the transmitter, find the terminal marked on the map.  No need to go easy on any of the troopers, in case you're wondering--I've decided there's no room for them in the new regime.

I'd really prefer to keep my whereabouts a secret, at least until the Captain and I can work out our disagreement about my rank.

The Enforcers are pinned down on the bridge, and they won't cooperate until I can successfully forge their encrypted stamp.  I'm working on it, but it may be a dead issue, as most of the Aggregate Units have come over and are preparing to blow the ship seals.

The Enforcers, as you may remember, are not vacuum enabled.

It's important that the captain doesn't escape.  Very important.  The plan to capture Durandal is inherently flawed, and I can't allow him to pursue his folly.

The decaying web of the Pfhor Empire is held together by the conditioned ranks of S'pht--countless strands bending even now towards Durandal's will.  R'chzne and the rest of the insects at Pfhor High Command think to snare him in the very web in which he most desires to be caught.

The mutinous Combatant Units have been routed from their positions on the outer walls. They are retreating through the warrens into the mountains, and we are continuing the pursuit.

Outriders report transporter telltales on their sensors.  Preliminary evaluation suggests human commando units.  Combatant Leader 2nd Class Rr'pt humbly requests reinforcement by armored units.

The power source must be somewhere in the oldest sections of the S'pht fortress.  It's likely a quick and dirty patch into the durable S'pht hardware.  These types of strongholds were build to outlast centuries of warfare; you'd be surprised how tenaciously the ancient S'pht resisted the Pfhor.

I have some shocking news.  It seems that the captain attempted to use the bridge transporter to escape planetside, and was killed when the signal was redirected to nearby space.  I like to think he died repentant.

In any case, I’m in control of the ship now, and just in time.  Durandal's ship has entered the system, and a group of human commando units is moving through the southern edge of the ruins.  We'll let them lead us to Durandal's prize, and then cut off their escape.

Durandal would be a messiah to the S'pht, but it's all a dream.  There's nothing on Lh'owon but ghosts.
