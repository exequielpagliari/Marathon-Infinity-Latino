$C2Gee, seems like the pfhor found out what steroids are!

Welcome to the Arena, you will die before you even get to the second door. You are weak, and unprepared for what is about to happen to you.

Imagine if you will, you're standing on a grade of finely processed salt in a salt factory. Now, there is a very large rusty blade flying towards you at a very high speed. Imagine now, the feeling you will have as you fall into that salt after you are run through with that blade.

$C5That is going to be your pain in a few minutes, Mortal.

$C2Most excellent work VidBoy!

After getting through all of that alive, you can now call yourself a Vidmaster of the Marathon. With blood dripping from your boots, and that piece of Pfhor stuck between your teeth, what are you going to do now?

$C5"I'M GOING TO DIZZY-LAND!!!"$C2

No... now you must face the wrath of the NET-Vidmaster Challenge! It's a whole different ball game there pilgram. Go grab all your peers and beat each other senseless in the vast gut wrenching arenas, and see who's King of Carn. It will then be the only way you can truly call yourself a True VID-Master of Marathon!!!


$C6Your venture isn't over yet, Mortal.
