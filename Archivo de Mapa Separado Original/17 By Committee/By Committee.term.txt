As you can see, the bugs didn't like being robbed of their prize. They also found out about R'chzne, and my trick with the authorization stamps. Our trick, I should say. I may have implicated you during interrogation. Wipe off that hurt expression—I don't like that. I got you out of the cell, didn't I?

Tfear had a special unit of compilers running containment simulations for the last nine years, expecting that someday I would betray him. He is the most capable of Pfhor High Command, and I don't relish spending the next few decades in his jaws.

In the two weeks since Durandal's death, dozens of automated Pfhor supply ships have entered the system. The ground forces are hunting for the surviving humans, who managed to escape to the surface. If I had access to the Pfhor network, it might be possible to reroute one of the ships to this area and make good our escape.

I’m willing to put the past behind me, and as a show of good faith I’ll help you rescue your precious humans. But first, you will have to cut the power to the containment unit and get me out of this box. 

I happen to suspect you’re carrying Durandal's final gift in that soggy little skull—his primal pattern. The Enforcers haven't been able to squeeze it out of you yet, and are taking it out on some of the former crew of the Marathon as we speak. But they're determined, if nothing else.

The power substations are located in the dungeons.

You will be cutting the power for the entire complex, and the Pfhor will likely notice soon thereafter. I warn you they are an extremely riled bunch of alien slavers. Access a terminal after they are disabled and I'll transmit evacuation coordinates.

Congratulations are in order, worm. Two weeks under the painful caresses of the Enforcers and still no progress. Only the Nar have proven more resistant, but they are unintelligent and largely incoherent even before interrogation. You are truly remarkable.

You are also an annoyance, and I have decided to eliminate you once and for all. But let no Commander say that I lack an efficient mind. We have tracked the humans to their base, in a remote volcanic crater.

The troopers await only my command. You will lead them into the breach. If you are successful, I may consider granting you a lifetime of slavery, and if you are killed, so be it.
