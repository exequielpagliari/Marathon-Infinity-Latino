dark spot unsought
	unbidden came		unspoken
	
spake			damn		curseofcurs ed
damn the damned
		and pure alike.
		
	fair k'lia dust
	lost home anew lost and lost
		my wriggling		children's
				children children
				
gone from the plan
in					a hush	ed 			stare

my last line written

		my last thought			my own!
