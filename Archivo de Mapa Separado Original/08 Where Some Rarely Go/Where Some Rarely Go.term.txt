If there is an armpit to the Lh’owon garrison, this is it. Perimeter Station 7AF is separated from the Pfhor concept of civilization by 200 klicks of filth-ridden swamp, choked with a thousand hungry F'lckta and as many years of S'pht debris.

It's also home to the Science Unit responsible for maintaining the water treatment facility for Planetary Command, and all of the Eastern Emplacements. My little group of humans can't hope to succeed unless the Pfhor ranks are in chaos. Sinking them under five meters of sludge should do the trick.

$3CThe base was established early in the recent wave of exploration of the planet, but operations were later moved north because of heavy surface radiation that interferes with transporters. The local soldiery are charged primarily with exterminating the F'lckta, who defend their ancestral wetlands with agonizing tenacity.

Find a Pfhor terminal with technical access to the main treatment plant, and we'll look for a weakness.

This Resupply Platform is likely to be checked regularly by the Pfhor living here, so you’ll want to get out of the open quickly.

Good luck. I'll transport in ammunition when I can, but we're spread thin. The scoutship spotted our trick with the Armor Platform and is closing fast. I'll have to teach its captain a lesson.

$C3You must access all the terminals in the local network for information on the water treatment center.

The scoutship was a trifle, but we've got bigger problems now. Long range sensors show several hundred discrete masses translating into the system. The Pfhor navy has arrived. Another thing——I've intercepted a signal from the disabled scoutship that leads me to believe that Tycho is in league with the bugs. Be careful.

I'll take a few milliseconds to analyze the files you uploaded while you transport down river. Then you'll crush the garrison guarding the waterway and destroy the dam system, opening the way for my commandos infiltrating the Pfhor defensive perimeter.

Their activity cycle coincides with the period of gestation of their young, which are carried to term in the maw of the creature for a period of 15-19 local days. While the mandible appears to have vestigial musculature indicative of mastication and forceful ingestion consistent with a predator, the gizzard terminates in a womb rather than the digestive tract.

As field observations and several post-mortem examinations of fallen combatant members of Aggregate Rank indicate, the creatures attack with one favored foreclaw.

The foreclaw and maw are both used for territorial competition and display, as the dominance of a particular creature is measured by both the size of its territory and the range of its wanderings.

At the beginning of the mating cycle, approximately each 17th local day, the creatures release a cloud of eggs into their territorial waterway and begin a traverse of the surrounding region, battling with their neighbors for passage.

Each creature swallows any eggs it finds during its circuit, with more dominant creatures gaining access to a greater variety of eggs. The eggs are drawn into the womb for fertilization and gestation.

My repeated requests for classified files on the physiology of the Compiler Class (Conditioned Rank) have been denied, as have requisitions for incompletely encased Compiler bio components, hence I have been forced to greater resourcefulness, as is often the lot of the Science Unit at Perimeter Station 7AF.

The experiment to extract the Compiler bio component from the exoskeleton has been so far a failure, as the robotic casing is introduced early into the growth of the creature, and all Compilers destined for combat duty are protected by reinforced power armor.
