I am an ass indeed: you may prove it by my long ears.  I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at this hands for my service but blows: when I am cold he heats me with beating, when I am warm he cools me with beating.  I am waked with it when I sleep; raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when I return: nay, I bear it on my shoulders as a beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lamed me, I shall beg it from door to door.
