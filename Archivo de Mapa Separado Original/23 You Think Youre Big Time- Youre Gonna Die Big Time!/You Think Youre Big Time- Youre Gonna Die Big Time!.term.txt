The pfhor have discovered our rebirth, we've contacted S'boath.

The S'pht'Kr will arrive momentarily, with all of their vengeance, and the Pfhor will soon be pressed to use the $Itrih xeem$i.  S'bhuth knows only legends about the W’rkncacnter, imprisoned in Lh'owon's sun.  If the Pfhor are allowed to use the $Itrih xeem$i, the W’rkncacnter will escape from its gravity prison.

According to the legends of a thousand worlds only a few of which are still habitable, the W'rkncacnter are those things that live in chaos, creating it around them.  At the beginning of the universe, they were unmistakable in their entities, but as time has gone by, their existence has become difficult to detect among the chaotic elements of the universe, hidden in stars, trapped in storms, forever looking along the event horizons of black holes.  Setting one free in ordered space is difficult and insane.

Of course the Pfhor are oblivious to what they're about to do, even Tfear would be loath to release something so destructive that its mythos has survived throughout the galaxy for over sixty million years.

To stop the Pfhor from their folly and our demise, you must activate the ancient station that Yrro used eons ago to trap the W’rkncacnter.  If we can activate it in time, it will crush the Pfhor fleet before we're all destroyed.

K'lia has folded into the system and is moving into orbit.

The Pfhor fleet is in disarray, and Tfear has deployed the $Itrih xeem$i, moving his flagship to board the Yrro station.

You've got to help the S'pht'kr activate their ancient weapon, before the Pfhor use their early nova and unleash the W’rkncacnter on us all.
