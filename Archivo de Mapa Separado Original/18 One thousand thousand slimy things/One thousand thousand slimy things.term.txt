Very impressive. The primary function of intelligence is the subordination of our instinctive desires, the mark of a strong species. Which is why your kind will serve well the needs of the Hindmost Creche. The Hindmost is of an intelligence so vast, it encompasses the span of the Pfhor, and to those privilege to serve Her, appears insane. That is the final function of the Commanding Rank, the thought that we keep forever in our minds, that we deny our selfish, willful needs, so that the Empire will survive.

The humans are escaping through the cone of the volcano, where they have activated containment fields to suppress the lava floe. I want nothing more than to cut them off so they can be captured, for long, useful lives in the conditioned ranks.

The containment fields are powered by multiple, redundant sources throughout the cone. You will have to deactivate them all.
