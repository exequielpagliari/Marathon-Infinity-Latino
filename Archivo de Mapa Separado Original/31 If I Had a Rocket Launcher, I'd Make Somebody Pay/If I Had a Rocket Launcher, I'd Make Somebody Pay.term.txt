$C2Ah, so you think your a bad-ass for getting past the first test huh? Well you will most certainly DIE NOW!

This test is easy, get to the end of the Gauntlet, it's that simple. 
     
Don't think to stand your ground, because it won't help you any.

$C5RUN, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! HAHAha...

$C2What's that I hear? Is someone sighing relief?

Don't go and get yourself all relaxed or anything like that, you are about to witness something that no mortal has ever seen!
